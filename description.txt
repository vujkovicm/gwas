In classical epi terms, longitudinal data stand for repeated measurements obtained of a trait within an individual over a period
of time (e.g. multiple measurements of systolic blood pressure over time). Despite the availability of multiple time point
measurements for each subject, many genetic analyses only use one single time point measurement or an average over all time
points for each subject. Fortunately, methods have been developed to jointly analyze the genetic association with multiple time
point measurements. Results from these methods have observed a substantial improvements in power.

Mixed effects models are a popular choice for modeling longitudinal data. Gauderman et al. (2003) summarized that this method 
in genome-wide analyses is represented by two basic approaches:

i. The two-step approach, where repeated measurements of a phenotype are modeled by mixed effects models to reduce to one or 
two summary statistics for each subject in the first step and then, these subject-specific statistics will be used in the 
second step for the linkage or genetic analysis.

ii. The joint modeling approach, e.g. a mixed effects model is used to jointly estimate genetic and longitudinal parameters. 
For example, genetic parameters may include additive polygenic and additive major gene effects. Longitudinal parameters may
include shared environmental and random environmental effects. The joint modeling approach has also been proposed for 
genome-wide association mapping by Furlotte et al. (2012), available at http://genetics.cs.ucla.edu/longGWAS/.
